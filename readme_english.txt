Description of the Factory Method in PHP
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This enables the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.

Concrete Examples:
Suppose we have an application that manages different types of products. We want a flexible method to create these products without tightly coupling the client code with the specific product classes.

Code Explanation:
Product Interface: This is a simple interface that defines the getType() method. All product classes must implement this interface.

ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB Classes: These are concrete implementations of the Product interface.

Factory Interface: This is an interface that declares the createProduct() method. All factories must implement this interface.

ConcreteFactoryA and ConcreteFactoryB Classes: These are concrete implementations of the Factory interface. Each factory knows how to create a specific type of product.

clientCode Function: This function accepts a factory as a parameter, uses the factory to create a product, and then displays the type of product created.

This pattern allows you to easily add new types of products and factories without modifying the client code. You can simply add new implementations of Product and Factory.
